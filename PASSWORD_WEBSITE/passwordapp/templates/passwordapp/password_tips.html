  <h1 class="display-4">10 Tips to Make and Keep Your Password Safe</h1>
  <p class="lead">Follow these tips to create strong and unique passwords that will keep your online accounts secure.</p>

  <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <h5>1. Use a passphrase instead of a password</h5>
      <p>A passphrase is a sequence of words that is easy for you to remember, but hard for others to guess.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <h5>2. Make it long and complex</h5>
      <p>Aim for a minimum of 12 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <h5>3. Avoid common patterns and sequences</h5>
      <p>Stay away from common patterns like "qwerty" or "123456", and avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <h5>4. Don't use personal information</h5>
      <p>Avoid using your name, birthdate, or common words that can be easily guessed by others.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <h5>5. Use a password manager</h5>
      <p>Consider using a password manager like LastPass or 1Password to generate and store unique, complex passwords for each account.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <h5>6. Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts</h5>
      <p>If a hacker gets access to one of your accounts, they'll have access to all of them if you're using the same password.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <h5>7. Don't share your passwords with anyone</h5>
      <p>Keep your passwords confidential and don't share them with friends, family, or coworkers.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <h5>8. Change your passwords regularly</h5>
      <p>Consider changing your passwords every 60-90 days to keep your accounts secure.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <h5>9. Use two-factor authentication</h5>
      <p>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <h5>10. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity</h5>
      <p>Regularly check your account activity and report any suspicious behavior to the relevant authorities.</p>
    </li>
